# Read both documents for next week. Write down what you learnt (what appears useful, what is surprising, â€¦) and your opinion on potential biases in both documents

=========================
[First Document](https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/report/The_State_of_Open_Data_2023/24428194)

There are more way to get the resource such as Specialist search engines (Unpaywall), Data warehouses (FAIRsharing.org), Databases for theses or academic works (Open Access Thesis and Dissertation), and Platforms for preprints or working papers (arXiv)

Data Management Plan contains

- **Collection and documentation** ~  describe the type, format and volume of the data you will be collecting
- **Backup and storage** ~ how will the data be stored
- **Legal and security issues** ~ what methods to ensure the protection of sensitive data
- **Responsibilities and resources** ~ : specify the roles and responsibilities of the people working on the project

Working in a reproducible approach by doing

- Manage bibliographical references
- Organise data, files and folders
- Version controling
- Automate certain recurring tasks

After deposit the thesis, we can choose for it to be freely acessible on the internet or restricted aceessible

Several reason why we need to choose open acess for the thesis

- Your work will be much more visible and downloaded and cited more by other researchers and students.
- This facilitates your integration into the academic community (consultation by a selection panel).
- A thesis that is more widely disseminated is much better protected against plagiarism than a work with more restricted dissemination.
- Download statistics can encourage publishers to propose publishing projects. You should however be careful with requests from companies that present themselves as publishing houses but do not actually offer any quality editorial work on the text of your thesis.
- Your thesis will have a permanent and validated online consultation address.

Several reason why we need to share the research data

- Dataset can be reused by the other researchers
- Research financed with public funding must be open to all
- Increase the visibility of your work
- Increase the chance to get cite more often
- Better guarantee of research transparency
